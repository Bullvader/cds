# Community Discord Services
CDS is designed by and for Discord Community owners and moderators.
The vision for this bot is ease of configuration and maintenance, as well as making the lives of moderators easier by automating tasks that are otherwise time-consuming.

This project uses Spring Framework and the JDA Discord API wrapper.

# Roblox Discord
The current versions of this project are designed for use within the Roblox Discord, so many implementations are tied into Rowboat functionality rather than standalone.
In the future, this project will hold its own solutions for message, user and infraction management.
