# Roblox Discord Services
Current plan is to evolve RDSS into a community project called Community Discord Services (CDS), so anyone can add this bot to their own community quickly and easily.

This project uses Spring Framework and the JDA Discord API wrapper.

# Contributing
This project won't be possible without your contribution. Make use of Issues and create your own pull requests if you'd like to add your own piece to this bot!
