# Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache-2.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project.
